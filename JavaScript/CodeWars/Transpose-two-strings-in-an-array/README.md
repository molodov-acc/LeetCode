# Transpose Two Strings

## Description

You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.

### Example

```javascript
transposeTwoStrings(["Hello", "World"]);
```

#### Output:

```
H W
e o
l r
l l
o d
```

## Notes:

- There should be **one space** between the two characters.
- You **don't** have to modify the case (i.e., no need to change to upper or lower).
- If one string is **longer** than the other, there should be a space where the character would be.
